# Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning
This project uses Python-based machine learning and data science libraries to build a model capable of predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease based on their clinical parameters. The notebook explores various techniques, including data exploration, feature analysis, and model evaluation, to achieve this goal.
