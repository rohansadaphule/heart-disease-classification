# Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning
This project uses Python-based machine learning and data science libraries to build a model capable of predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease based on their clinical parameters. The notebook explores various techniques, including data exploration, feature analysis, and model evaluation, to achieve this goal.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to predict heart disease in patients using their medical attributes, such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical measurements. We use exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest), and evaluation metrics to develop and assess the model's performance.
